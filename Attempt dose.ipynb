They’re a small percentage of the American people, virulent people. Some of them are the dregs of society.”\n",

    "# “This bill would require the Border Patrol to divert resources from its core missions and create a new medical screening for those who illegally cross and enter the country between ports of entry.”\n",
    "# Republican Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said in a statement that the Democratic bill was wrong on multiple levels.\n",

They just passed legislation that will give illegal immigrants better health care records than our veterans and servicemembers.

    "# Meanwhile, an EHR system accessible between both the VA and the DoD is set to be implemented in some VA hospitals only as soon as 2020, and the full modernization effort, which officially began last May, was set to be rolled out over a decade, the Military Times reported.\n",
    "# But there are other problems with the bill, Walker said.\n",

DHS staff along the border are doing the best they can to keep up with screening illegal border crossers and this bill will make it harder for them to do their job without actually helping anyone,” he said.\n",

WASHINGTON—In an effort to combat the effects of climate change, federal authorities responded to rising sea levels by patting the East Coast with towels, sources confirmed Friday. “Now more than ever, it is important that we take action to protect our coastlines with ultra-absorbent linens,” said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, who confirmed that the agency had dispatched teams across the region to mitigate any potential damage by wadding up, rolling up, and spreading towels across its beaches. “We’re proud to unveil this as the greatest U.S. climate change initiative to date. Simply giving everything a good patting down will preserve and even create miles of coastlines that we didn’t previously have. Plus, feel—they’re super soft.” At press time, authorities were scrambling to respond to the crisis caused by the unprecedented concentrations of mildew in the air. \n",

MILFORD, CT—Addressing recent questions about the integrity of ingredients in one of the chain’s most popular sandwiches, Subway CEO John Chidsey issued a formal apology Thursday for trusting a fish who allegedly submitted false documents to the restaurant in order to pass as a tuna. “Subway has always prided itself on thoroughly vetting anyone who will represent our brand, but we failed you this time, placing our trust in what turned out to be a common carp,” said Chidsey, adding that while the fish in question went through several rounds of vigorous interviews before it was brought onto the team, its fraudulent credentials claiming membership in the Thunnus albacares species were never questioned. “Though we, too, are victims in this situation, ultimately the onus was on us to more closely examine this candidate’s purported background as a yellowfin tuna. In our defense, the paperwork was all there, we simply failed to do our due diligence and check this fish’s references. Perhaps if we had, we would not have been taken in by this duplicitous carp. We just got mixed up with the wrong fish, that’s all.” Chidsey went on to address allegations regarding the role the carp played in his personal life, acknowledging the two had carried on a consensual, extramarital affair during the fish’s brief tenure at the company.\n",

    "\n",
    "U.S. officials at intake centers in the United Arab Emirates and in Wisconsin have identified numerous incidents in which Afghan girls have been presented to authorities as the “wives” of much older men. While child marriage is not uncommon in Afghanistan, the U.S. has strict policies against human trafficking that include prosecutions for offenders and sanctions for countries that don’t crack down on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One internal document seen by The Associated Press says the State Department has sought “urgent guidance” from other agencies after purported child brides were brought to Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. Another document, described to the AP by officials familiar with it, says Afghan girls at a transit site in Abu Dhabi have alleged they have been raped by older men they were forced to marry in order to escape Afghanistan.\n",

    "The State Department had no immediate comment on the documents or the veracity of the details in them. Officials say that they take all such allegations seriously but that many of them are anecdotal and difficult to prove, particularly amid the crush of Afghan evacuees at multiple locations in the Middle East, Europe and the United States.\n",

Relevant portions of the document, titled “Afghanistan Task Force SitRep No. 63,” were obtained by the AP.\n",

    "news2 = '''The road to a Texas law that bans most abortions in the state, sidestepping for now the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, began in a town called Waskom, population 1,600.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Supreme Court’s decision this past week not to interfere with the state’s strict abortion law, provoked outrage from liberals and cheers from many conservatives. President Joe Biden assailed it. But the decision also astonished many that Texas could essentially outmaneuver Supreme Court precedent on women’s constitutional right to abortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas’ abortion law S.B. 8 follows a model first used in Waskom to ban abortion within its boundaries in 2019. The novel legal approach used by the city on Texas’ border with Louisiana is one envisioned by a former top lawyer for the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right to Life East Texas director Mark Lee Dixon, 36, a Southern Baptist minister, championed Waskom’s abortion ban. Through his state senator, Bryan Hughes, he met Jonathan F. Mitchell, a former top lawyer for the state of Texas. Mitchell became his attorney and advised him on crafting the ordinance, Dixon said in an interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinance shields Waskom from lawsuits by saying city officials can’t enforce the abortion ban. Instead, private citizens can sue anyone who performs an abortion in the city or assists someone in obtaining one. The law was largely symbolic, however, because the city did not have a clinic performing abortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly three dozen other cities in the state followed Waskom’s lead. Among them is Lubbock, where a Planned Parenthood clinic stopped performing abortions this year as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitchell has declined interviews, but Dixon called him a “brilliant guy” and said he was “extremely grateful” for his help. Hughes, who later became the author of the Texas law, echoed those sentiments. The two have known each other for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Hughes would not assign credit for Texas’ approach to a single person, saying many lawyers and law professors advised on the legislation, ultimately S.B. 8 followed the Waskom model in terms of how the law is enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The law, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. At least 12 other states have enacted bans early in pregnancy, but all have been blocked from going into effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike laws in other states, however, Texas’ law is unique in prohibiting state officials from enforcing the ban. Instead, it created a so-called private right of action allowing anyone — even someone outside Texas — to sue abortion providers and anyone else who helps someone get an abortion. Under the law, anyone who successfully sues another person would be entitled to at least $10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The private right-of-action wrinkle envisioned by Mitchell has so far kept challenges to the law from succeeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitchell, 45, has spent the last 15 years moving back and forth between working in government and teaching at law schools such as Stanford and the University of Texas at Austin. A graduate of Wheaton College and the University of Chicago Law School, he was a law clerk to the late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n",
    "\n",
    "And he went on to serve as Texas solicitor general from 2010 to 2015. He was a volunteer attorney on former President Donald Trump’s transition team and was unsuccessfully nominated by Trump to lead an agency tasked with making the government work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "University of Chicago law professor William Baude called him a “born law professor,” “creative and knowledgeable.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A law review article Mitchell wrote that was published in 2018 gave guidance to lawmakers worried about courts blocking their laws. He said lawmakers could protect their legislation by including a private right of action. He said the strategy could apply to a wide range of laws such as campaign finance, gun control and abortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is practically impossible to bring a pre-enforcement challenge to statutes that establish private rights of action, because the litigants who will enforce the statute are hard to identify until they actually bring suit,” he wrote in one footnote.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Texas’ law, things have played out as he predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, even some conservatives have questioned Texas’ approach. Dissenting from the high court’s decision not to step in this past week, Chief Justice John Roberts called Texas’ law “not only unusual, but unprecedented.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The legislature has imposed a prohibition on abortions after roughly six weeks, and then essentially delegated enforcement of that prohibition to the populace at large,” he wrote. “The desired consequence appears to be to insulate the State from responsibility for implementing and enforcing the regulatory regime.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor was blunt. “It cannot be the case that a State can evade federal judicial scrutiny by outsourcing the enforcement of unconstitutional laws to its citizenry,” she wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high court’s action, however, is unlikely to be the final word on the law. More legal challenges now that the law is in force are likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "GOP lawmakers and abortion opponents in at least five other Republican-controlled states — Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, North Dakota and South Dakota – said they are considering pushing bills similar to the Texas law and its citizen-enforcement provision.\n",

    "news3= '''WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Friday directed the declassification of certain documents related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a supportive gesture to victims’ families who have long sought the records in hopes of implicating the Saudi government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order, coming little more than a week before the 20th anniversary of the attacks, is a significant moment in a yearslong tussle between the government and the families over what classified information about the run-up to the attacks could be made public. That conflict was on display last month when many relatives, survivors and first responders came out against Biden’s participation in 9/11 memorial events if the documents remained classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biden said Friday that he was making good on a campaign commitment by ordering the declassification review and pledged that his administration “will continue to engage respectfully with members of this community.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The significant events in question occurred two decades ago or longer, and they concern a tragic moment that continues to resonate in American history and in the lives of so many Americans,” the executive order states. “It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency, relying on classification only when narrowly tailored and necessary.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The order directs the Justice Department and other executive branch agencies to begin a declassification review, and requires that declassified documents be released over the next six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brett Eagleson, whose father, Bruce, was among the World Trade Center victims and who is an advocate for other victims’ relatives, commended the action as a “critical first step.” He said the families would be closely watching the process to make sure that the Justice Department follows through and acts “in good faith.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The first test will be on 9/11, and the world will be watching. We look forward to thanking President Biden in person next week as he joins us at Ground Zero to honor those who died or were injured 20 years ago,” Eagleson said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the practical impact of the executive order and any new documents it might yield was not immediately clear. Public documents released in the last two decades, including by the 9/11 Commission, have detailed numerous Saudi entanglements but have not proved government complicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A long-running lawsuit in federal court in New York aims to hold the Saudi government accountable and alleges that Saudi officials provided significant support to some of the hijackers before the attacks. The lawsuit took a major step forward this year with the questioning under oath of former Saudi officials, and family members have long regarded the disclosure of declassified documents as an important step in making their case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Saudi government has denied any connection to the attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fifteen of the hijackers were Saudi, as was Osama bin Laden, whose al-Qaida network was behind the attacks. Particular scrutiny has centered on the support offered to the first two hijackers to arrive in the U.S., Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, including from a Saudi national with ties to the Saudi government who helped the men find and lease an apartment in San Diego and who had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though many documents examining potential Saudi ties have been released, U.S. officials have long regarded other records as too sensitive for disclosure. On Thursday, victims’ families and survivors urged the Justice Department’s inspector general to investigate the FBI’s apparent inability to locate key pieces of evidence they’ve been seeking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Justice Department revealed last month that the FBI had recently completed an investigation examining certain 9/11 hijackers and potential co-conspirators, and that it was working toward providing more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the terms of the executive order, the FBI must complete by Sept. 11 its declassification review of documents from that probe, which it has referred to as the “Subfile Investigation.” Additional documents, including any phone and bank records and reports with investigative findings, are to be reviewed with an eye for disclosure over the course of the next six months.\n",

    "news4 = '''RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Almost instantly after most abortions were banned in Texas, Democrats were decrying the new law as unconstitutional, an assault on women’s health that must be challenged. But the reaction from many Republicans on the other side hasn’t been nearly as emphatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though some in the GOP are celebrating the moment as a long-sought win for the anti-abortion rights movement, others are minimizing the meaning of the Supreme Court’s Wednesday midnight decision that allowed the bill to take effect. A few are even slamming the court and the law.\n",

    "“I’m pro-life,” said Republican Glenn Youngkin, a GOP candidate for governor in increasingly Democratic Virginia, where the only open governor’s race in the nation is coming up in November. When pressed on the Texas law by a reporter, he quickly noted that he supports exceptions in cases of rape, incest and where the mother’s life is in danger — exceptions notably not included in the new law.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixed reactions illustrate the political risks for the GOP as their anti-abortion allies begin actually achieving goals they have long sought. Americans are hardly of one mind on the issue, and loudly defending the nation’s toughest curbs — in Virginia or political battlegrounds like Georgia, Arizona or Florida — in next year’s midterm elections won’t be hazard-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Youtube video thumbnail\n",
    "“It is going to be a very motivating issue for women who haven’t typically been single-issue pro-choice voters,” said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. That includes suburban women and independents in swing House districts and competitive governor’s races who in past elections didn’t believe Roe v. Wade was truly under threat, Matthews said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new Texas law represents the most significant threat yet to the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion. Surveys suggest that ruling still has broad support — 69% of voters in last year’s elections said Roe v. Wade should be left as is, compared with just 29% saying it should be overturned, according to AP VoteCast, a poll of the electorate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Democrats and abortion-rights advocates, who have sometimes been frustrated by voters taking access for granted, vowed Thursday to use the moment to wake people up. They promised to go after not just GOP candidates and office holders who support the Texas measure and others like it but also corporations that support them. Some reignited calls to end Senate filibuster rules to give abortion access a better chance at passage in Congress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would soon vote on codifying Roe v. Wade into law, though chances in the Senate are all but nil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe already has been making abortion a key issue. He points to secretly recorded video in which Youngkin tells a woman posing as an abortion opponent that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood but can’t talk about it publicly because “as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won’t win my independent votes that I have to get.”\n",
    "\n",
    "On Thursday McAuliffe warned that if Youngkin wins and Republicans take over the state House ”there’s a good chance that we could see Virginia go the way of Texas.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Texas law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and often before women know they’re pregnant. Rather than be enforced by government authorities, the law gives citizens the right to file civil suits and collect damages against anyone aiding an abortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, tweeted that she wanted her office to compare her state’s laws with the new Texas one “to make sure we have the strongest pro-life laws on the books in SD.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But such views were hardly universal in her party.\n",
    "\n",
    "In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster this year signed a restriction requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds checking for cardiac activity and prohibiting abortion if it’s found, unless the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, or the mother’s life was in danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asked Thursday if he would support a Texas-style bill, such as one without exceptions for rape and incest, McMaster said he viewed South Carolina’s law as “superior.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine called the Texas law “extreme and harmful.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell downplayed the Supreme Court’s action as “a highly technical decision.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the conservative-majority court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Texas law. The justices instead refused to block its implementation and issued a brief statement saying the decision “in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The justices’ role ensures that the court’s makeup will be part of the revived political debate. Liberal lawmakers backed by advocates who helped power President Joe Biden to office want to expand the number of justices to rebalance power.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Democrats can either abolish the filibuster and expand the court, or do nothing as millions of people’s bodies, rights and lives are sacrificed for far-right minority rule,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., wrote on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a majority of American support Roe v. Wade, abortion opponents have typically been more likely to let the issue determine their votes. According to AP VoteCast, just 3% of voters in the 2020 presidential election called abortion the single most important issue facing the country, but they leaned resoundingly toward Republican President Donald Trump, 89% to just 9% for Democrat Biden. In a separate question, 18% of voters called Supreme Court nominations “the single most important factor” in their presidential votes. Those voters leaned toward Biden by a relatively narrow margin, 53% to 46%.\n",
    "\n",
    "A June poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that most Americans think abortion should be limited after the first trimester, but about 6 in 10 said it should usually be legal in the first three months of pregnancy. More than 8 in 10 said it should be legal in cases of rape or incest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The poll found that younger adults are especially likely to support legal abortion. Sixty-three percent of those under age 45 said abortion should usually be legal, compared with 51% of those 45 and older. Still, even young adults support some limits on abortion based on the time of pregnancy, with majorities across all age groups saying most abortions should be illegal by the third trimester.\n",

       "\"From the network that: Cannot (or will not) confirm the authenticity of the Project Veritas videos Cannot explain how Donna Brazile gave a primary debate question in advance to Hillary Clinton (that verbatim was provided by Roland Martin to CNN the next day). Brazile has since been let go from CNN after it was discovered she provided the Clinton campaign another question before a debate. Told us it is “illegal” to possess the stolen documents from Wikileaks. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo said, “It’s different for the media. So everything you learn about this, you’re learning from us.” Wrongly claimed Hillary did not laugh over defending a rapist Brushed off Clinton sex assaults as ‘Conspiracy Theory Land’ Misquoted Trump , then said he sounds like ‘Stalin or Hitler’ Intentionally removed critical audio from the footage of Keith Scott’s death, according to a law enforcement media company Ignored Clinton rape charges while bolstering Hillary \\nFrom CNN’s post : It’s time for a new rule on the web: Double, no, triple check before you share. Especially if it seems too good to be true. \\nWhy? Look no further than Donald Trump’s Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that “Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.” \\nNot only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comey’s name was at the top of Facebook’s “trending” box; and Twitter’s “moments” section had a prominent story about the controversy . (I guess I’ll have to take their word for it. I don’t use Google nor Facebook. As for Twitter, well, just ask Jack .) You can trust Facebook… \\nNevertheless, Trump’s wrong-headed “burying” claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 “liked” it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide. \\nThe rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count. \\nSo that’s what I recommended a “triple check before you share” rule. \\nNew web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars. \\nBut the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition. \\nA recent BuzzFeed study of “hyperpartisan Facebook pages” found that these pages “are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.” (There you have it. From the expert journalism of “BuzzFeed.”) \\nThe less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared — which does not bode well for the nation’s news literacy during a long, bitter election season. “Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,” the BuzzFeed reporting team said. \\nOn a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook’s “trending” box — a problem that the company says it is trying to address. \\nIn a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined “Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: ‘I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump’s Rally.'” \\nA close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trump’s son Eric Trump in early October. “Finally, the truth comes out,” he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story. \\nAs soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of “fake news.” But that’s a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth. \\nFake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites: \\n#1, Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you; \\n#2, Hyperpartisan sites that aren’t lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party; \\n#3, “Hybrids” that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction. \\nThese sites aren’t going away, so it’s up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it. Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help — they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks. Josh Stearns from Democracy Fund \\nJosh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play. \\n“Fact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,” he told me. “At a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.” \\nTrump’s false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter “burying” bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the “very dishonest media.” Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter. \\nTrump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a “social media blackout.” The blog post contained false information. I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded. \\nDCG\""

    "bb2 = '''Americans involved in the private evacuation of U.S. citizens, green card holders, and Afghan allies left stranded in Afghanistan by the Biden administration reportedly blame baffling delays from the U.S. State Department for preventing rescue flights from leaving the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the State Department reportedly asserted that it is the Taliban jihadis who refuse to give several charter flights carrying American citizens and green card holders permission to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Sunday, Fox News reported that it spoke to three individuals involved in the private evacuation efforts who blame the State Department for blocking rescue flights from leaving Afghanistan, including two who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing the rescue operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the anonymous sources reportedly suggested the State Department’s obstruction is fueled in part by “embarrassment that private individuals are rescuing Americans whom the U.S. government left behind.”\n",

    "All three indicated “the State Department’s delays are recklessly endangering American lives,” Fox News pointed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Echoing the two anonymous sources, Rick Clay, who runs the private rescue group PlanB, declared that the State Department is the only obstacle preventing the evacuation flights he is organizing from leaving Afghanistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Fox News, one of their unnamed sources said:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is zero place to be negotiating with American lives. Those are our people standing on the tarmac, and all it takes is a f—ing phone call. … If one life is lost as a result of this, the blood is on the White House’s hands. The blood is on their hands. … It is not the Taliban that is holding this up – as much as it sickens me to say that – it is the United States government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and State Department spokesman Ned Price denied that the Biden administration blocked any private rescue flights from leaving Afghanistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Sunday, CBS News reported seeing excerpts of an email from the State Department to members of congress that asserted the Taliban was not allowing charter flights to take off from the Mazar-i-Sharif airstrip in northern Afghanistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is a Taliban decision to ground flights in Mazar-i-Sharif,” the email declared. “We are, however, providing guidance and assistance to the extent possible — and with an emphasis on safety— to private entities working out of Mazar.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Taliban is basically holding them hostage to get more out of the Americans,” an unnamed senior congressional source told CBS News.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement to CBS News suggesting the Taliban is to blame for keeping private evacuation planes on the ground, the State Department acknowledged:\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have personnel on the ground, we do not have air assets in the country, we do not control the airspace – whether over Afghanistan or elsewhere in the region.\n",
    "…\n",
    "Given these constraints, we also do not have a reliable means to confirm the basic details of charter flights, including who may be organizing them, the number of U.S. citizens and other priority groups on-board, the accuracy of the rest of the manifest, and where they plan to land, among many other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the department vowed to “hold the Taliban to its pledge to let people freely depart Afghanistan,” adding that “the entire international community is focused on whether they live up to their commitments.”\n",

    "Last Thursday, the State Department informed Clay’s rescue group their flights out of Afghanistan “would eventually receive approval … following the review of their manifest.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The task could take several days, Fox News noted, adding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clay has a manifest of 4,500 names of U.S. citizens, green card holders, SIVs [Special Immigrant Visas], and refugees trying to get stateside. So far, they’ve given the State Department 800 names for the first round of flights.\n",

    "President Joe Biden capitulated to the Taliban’s demand that all U.S. troops had to leave Afghanistan by August 31, including the 5,000 deployed to help evacuate Americans and Afghan allies.\n",
    "\n",
    "On August 15, the Taliban entered Kabul, marking the end of an aggressive campaign to regain control of Afghanistan as the U.S. military was leaving the country.\n",
